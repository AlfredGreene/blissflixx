# USING

When you first connect your browser to the BlissFlixx server you should be presented with the following page showing your installed channels:

![BlissFlixx Homepage](img/channels.png)

This page will allow you to browse all the channels that you have installed and enabled.

To remove any channels you are not interested in click on the settings cog icon on the top menu bar and then select the 'MANAGE CHANNELS' option.

Now select a channel such as Youtube Movies. You will then see a screen like the following: 

![Youtube Movies Channel](img/movies_chan.png)

The default view is to list all the latest movies submitted to the channel. However you can also select the categories at the top of the page to view movies of the selected genre.

To play a movie simply click on the title link and the movie will start playing.

You can also search for specific movies from the search box.

All the other channels behave in a similar fashion with a list of categories and an optional search facility.

You can also add any media item to a playlist which is covered in the following section.

### PLAYLISTS

You can organise your media by creating playlists:

To create a playlist click on the 'NEW PLAYLIST' button and specify a title. You can then go and add a thumbnail and description for the playlist by clicking on the 'Edit Playlist' button.

When you are browsing your channels you will have an option to add items to your created playlists.

### PLAY URL

If you want to play something that is not provided by any of your channels then you can use this page to play it. First select the play icon in the menu bar and then copy the URL of the page containing the video and paste it into the 'What to Play' box. You will then be able to play and/or add it to a playlist. 

Note that you can also play torrents and magnet links by pasting the link as documented above.

### SEARCH

The search page allows you to search all of your channels simultaneously. Simply enter your query terms into the search box and you will be presented with the results grouped by channel.

### SETTINGS

The settings page currently contains two options. The first - MANAGE CHANNELS - allows you to disable or enable any installed channels. 

The second option - RESTART & UPDATE - will restart and also update the server to the latest release. If you come across any problems make sure you first update the server to the latest version to check if the issue has already been fixed.
